</div></blockquote>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The &#8220;py2sis&#8221; command is used to pack a Python for S60 application script
and its auxiliary files (if any) into a Symbian installation package
(SIS).</p>
<p>PARAMETERS</p>
<blockquote>
<div>src</div></blockquote>
<p>The source script or directory name. When a directory name is given, the
directory structure is preserved under an application specific private
directory (&#8220;private&lt;uid&gt;&#8221;) on the phone. A file called &#8220;default.py&#8221;
is required to exist on the root of the directory given. This will be
the main file that starts the application. (See option &#8220;&#8211;extrasdir&#8221;
below for more options for file placement.)</p>
<p>When a regular file name is given, it will be located under the
application specific private directory, with the name &#8220;default.py&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>sisfile</div></blockquote>
<p>Path of the SIS file to create. If a directory name is given, output
file name is derived from input file name and application version (see
option &#8220;&#8211;version&#8221; below). This is also the case when no SIS file name
is given.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;appname=AppName
-n AppName</div></blockquote>
<p>Name of the application. If no application name is given, it will be
derived from the input file name.</p>
<p>This name is used as the base for all generated file names (EXE, icon,
resources) on the phone. It will also be used as the default caption if
none are given, and a temporary UID (see option &#8220;&#8211;uid&#8221; below) will be
generated from application name if not given explicitly.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;uid=0x01234567
-u 0x01234567</div></blockquote>
<p>Symbian UID for the application. If the UID option is not given, the
main Python file (&#8220;default.py&#8221;, see parameter &#8220;src&#8221; above) will be
scanned for a special string. If no UID can be found, a temporary UID is
generated from the application name (see option &#8220;&#8211;appname&#8221; and command
&#8220;genuid&#8221; above).</p>
<p>The special UID string can appear anywhere in the main Python file,
including comments and as part of string literals. It is of the form</p>
<blockquote>
<div>SYMBIAN_UID = UID</div></blockquote>
<p>, where whitespace around the equals sign is optional. UID is in the
same format as with the command line parameter (see option &#8220;&#8211;uid&#8221;
above).</p>
<p>Note: Use a real UID for all applications to be distributed. The
auto-generated test-range UID is only meant for development and testing,
not for real applications. UIDs can be ordered from Symbian Signed [12].
If you have already ordered UIDs for 1st or 2nd Edition phones, to use
these UIDs in 3rd Edition phones the first hex digit (a &#8220;1&#8221;) needs to be
changed to an &#8220;f&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also note: When changing the application name (or source file /
directory name in case no application name is explicitly given), the
temporary UID changes and the SIS package will be considered a new
application on the phone, unless an UID is explicitly specified.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;version=1.0.0
-r 1.0.0</div></blockquote>
<p>Application version: X.Y.Z or X,Y,Z (major, minor, build). There may be
a &#8220;v&#8221; or &#8220;V&#8221; in front of the major number. Minor and build numbers are
optional.</p>
<p>If the version option is not given, the main Python file (&#8220;default.py&#8221;,
see parameter &#8220;src&#8221; above) will be scanned for a special string. If no
version can be found, it defaults to 1.0.0.</p>
<p>The special version string can appear anywhere in the main Python file,
including comments and as part of string literals. It is of the form</p>
<blockquote>
<div>SIS_VERSION = &#8220;1.0.0&#8221;</div></blockquote>
<p>, where whitespace around the equals sign is optional. Version is in the
same format as with the command line parameter (see option &#8220;&#8211;version&#8221;
above), except that it may optionally be enclosed in single or double
quotes.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;lang=EN,...
-l EN,...</div></blockquote>
<p>Comma separated list of two-character language codes. These are the
languages that the SIS file claims to support, English by default.
Application must then somehow determine which language was selected
during install. Symbian installation tools reference [13] lists the
available language codes.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;icon=icon.svg
-i icon.svg</div></blockquote>
<p>Icon file in SVG-Tiny format. If no icon is given, the Python logo is
used as the icon. The Python logo is a trademark of the Python Software
Foundation.</p>
<p>Ensymble does not support the old style MBM bitmap icons.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>&#8211;shortcaption=&#8221;App. Name&#8221;,...
-s &#8220;App. Name&#8221;,...</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;caption=&#8221;Application Name&#8221;,...
-c &#8220;Application Name&#8221;,...</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Comma separated list of short and long captions in all selected
languages, i.e. there must be as many comma separated captions as there
are languages listed with the &#8220;&#8211;lang&#8221; option. If no captions are given,
application name is used (see option &#8220;&#8211;appname&#8221; above). If only the
short captions are given, long captions will use those instead.</p>
<p>Captions are visible names used in various places on the phone display.
Short caption is displayed under the application icon when using the
grid layout. Long caption is used on top of the screen when the
application is launched and beside the icon in list layout. Long caption
is also used as the package name, which is displayed during application
installation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;drive=C
-f C</div></blockquote>
<p>Installation drive &#8220;C&#8221; or &#8220;E&#8221; or &#8220;any&#8221;, to select where the SIS is to be
installed. Default is &#8220;any&#8221;, which causes the phone to ask the user
where to install the package.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;extrasdir=root
-x root</div></blockquote>
<p>Name of &#8220;extras&#8221; directory under the application source directory. The
extras directory contains a directory tree which is placed under the
root of the installation drive, instead of in the application private
directory. If no extras directory name is given, this feature is
disabled.</p>
<p>Option &#8220;&#8211;extrasdir&#8221; is similar to the &#8220;simplesis&#8221; command (see below).
It allows placing files under &#8220;sysbin&#8221; and &#8220;resource&#8221;, for example.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;textfile=mytext_%C.txt
-t mytext_%C.txt</div></blockquote>
<p>Text file (or pattern, see below) to display during install. If none is
given, no extra text will be displayed during install.</p>
<p>Files to display are in UTF-8 encoding, without Byte-Order Marker (BOM).
The file name may contain formatting characters that are substituted for
each selected language (see option &#8220;&#8211;lang&#8221; above). If no formatting
characters are present, the same text will be used for all languages.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>%%           - literal %
%n           - language number (01 - 99)
%c           - two-character language code in lowercase letters
%C           - two-character language code in capital letters
%l           - language name in English, using only lowercase letters
%l           - language name in English, using mixed case letters</div></blockquote>
<p>For example, if there are files named &#8220;mytext_EN.txt&#8221;, &#8220;mytext_GE.txt&#8221;
and &#8220;mytext_SP.txt&#8221;, a pattern of &#8220;mytext_%C.txt&#8221; will be able to use
them.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;cert=mycert.cer
-a mycert.cer</div></blockquote>
<p>Certificate to use for signing in PEM (text) format.</p>
<p>SIS files for Symbian OS v9 and later are required to be digitally
signed. Unsigned packages will not install on the phone. A
self-generated (&#8220;self-signed&#8221; in crypto parlance) certificate will do,
but only a restricted subset of features (&#8220;capabilities&#8221;, see option
&#8220;&#8211;caps&#8221; below) are available for self-signed applications.</p>
<p>If no certificate and its private key are given, Ensymble uses a default
self-signed certificate. Software authors are encouraged to create their
own unique certificates for SIS packages that are to be distributed.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;privkey=mykey.key
-k mykey.key</div></blockquote>
<p>Private key of the certificate in PEM (text) format. If option &#8220;&#8211;cert&#8221;
(above) is given, this option is required as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;passphrase=12345
-p 12345</div></blockquote>
<p>Pass phrase of the private key.</p>
<p>Note: Using command line options to give the pass phrase is insecure.
Any user of the computer will be able to see command lines of started
programs and thus will see the pass phrase in plain view. Instead,
standard input should be used (see examples below).</p>
<p>If no pass phrase is given on the command line or standard input, it
will be asked interactively.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;caps=Cap1+Cap2+...
-b Cap1+Cap2+...</div></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;caps=0x12345
-b 0x12345</div></blockquote>
<p>Capability names separated by &#8220;+&#8221; or a numeric capability bitmask. If no
capability option is given, the application will not have any special
capabilities. Symbian Signed [12] has an FAQ which explains all the
available capabilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;vendor=Name,...
-d Name,...</div></blockquote>
<p>Comma separated list of vendor names in all selected languages, i.e.
there must be as many comma separated vendor names as there are
languages listed with the &#8220;&#8211;lang&#8221; option. Alternatively, if only one
vendor name is given, it will be used for all languages. If no vendor
names are given then &#8220;Ensymble&#8221; will be used.</p>
<p>Vendor name is visible during installation and on the Application
manager, except when using self-signed certificates (see option &#8220;&#8211;cert&#8221;
above).</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;autostart
-g</div></blockquote>
<p>Flag to control automatic startup of the application. On S60 3rd Edition
phones, an application can register itself to be automatically started
when the phone is turned on.</p>
<p>Note: Self-signed applications and applications with UID in the
unprotected range cannot register to be automatically started (see
options &#8220;&#8211;uid&#8221; and &#8220;&#8211;cert&#8221; above).</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;runinstall
-R</div></blockquote>
<p>Run the application after installation. After copying all files to the
phone, the application is automatically started.</p>
<p>Note: Phones will ignore this flag in SIS files using self-signed
certificates (see option &#8220;&#8211;cert&#8221; above).</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8211;heapsize=min,max
-H min,max</div></blockquote>
<p>Heap size limits for the application. Defaults of 4 kilobytes and one
megabyte are used if no heap size option is given. If only one value is
given, it is used as both the heap minimum and heap maximum value.</p>
<p>Values may have suffix &#8220;k&#8221; or &#8220;M&#8221; (case insensitive) to denote kilobytes
(1024 bytes) and megabytes (1048576 bytes), respectively.</p>
<p>The heap minimum value determines if a program is allowed to start. If
less than the set amount of memory is available, program start-up fails.
The heap maximum value limits the memory a program can allocate. Memory
allocations beyond the set limit will fail. The default of one megabyte
is usually enough, but processing large datasets such as images from an
integrated camera might require setting the heap maximum value higher.</p>
<p>EXAMPLES</p>
<p>Note: The command lines below may be wrapped over multiple lines due to
layout constraints. In reality, each of them should be contained in one
physical command line.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>$ ensymble.py py2sis myprog.py</div></blockquote>
<p>This generates a SIS file called &#8220;myprog_v1_0_0.sis&#8221; in current working
directory. This SIS file is ready to be uploaded to a S60 3rd Edition
phone. Package version defaults to 1.0.0, a test-range UID is
auto-generated for the package and a default self-signed certificate is
used to digitally sign the SIS file. A default icon (the Python logo) is
used for application icon.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>$ echo &#8220;12345&#8221; | ensymble.py py2sis</dt>
<dd>&#8211;cert mycert.cer &#8211;privkey mykey.key
myprog.py</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Pass phrase can be given in Ensymble standard input, so that it will not
be visible to all users of the computer (see option &#8220;&#8211;passphrase&#8221;
above).</p>
